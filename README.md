This Prework Study Guide was made to make notes for bootcamp student. This project tests the basics of coding using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git conventions. It helps students to easily recall coding knowledge through simplified notes. Through the process of making this site, I learned how to construct and deploy a website.
